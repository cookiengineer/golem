Gooey (GUI) is a Pure Go Web UI framework made for stateless HTML in Web Views.
It bridges the gaps between Go, WebASM, Browser APIs, unified App Layouts and reusable Themes.


# Opinions

**HTML Elements**

- Static elements can never be removed from the DOM
- Static elements can have DOM event listeners
- Static elements always have an `id` property
- Dynamic elements can be removed from the DOM
- Dynamic elements should not have DOM event listeners

**App Layout**

- App Layout always consists of `header`, `main`, and `footer` elements
- App Views are represented by different `main > section[data-view=...]` elements
- App Views can contain `aside` elements representing the sidebar

**Web Clients**

- Web Clients are REST API clients using either [fetch](/source/fetch) or [xhr](/source/xhr)
- Web Clients are fulfill an `interface` with `Validate() bool, err`
- Web Clients are routable via a `map[URL]struct` for each supported route

**Web Forms**

Note: This is currently work-in-progress

- Web Forms are static elements
- Web Forms with `enctype="application/json"` use a REST compatible API endpoint
- Web Forms with an `action` URL are automatically validateable
- Web Forms are serializable via `json.Marshal()` into a `struct`
- Web Forms are fulfill an `interface` with `Validate() bool, err`

--------

[1] This feature is implemented, but not supported across all Browsers. It is disabled to prevent WebASM runtime errors that are irrecoverable.

[2] This feature is implemented asynchronously and uses a go `chan`. It only works with `tinygo` as a compiler as of now. If your WebASM binary
    hangs when using this, use the synchronous XMLHttpRequest APIs instead.


## Work-in-Progress

Currently, this library is in a working state, but also a bit experimental due to the nature of
upstream WebASM support quirks. There's a separate [TODO.md](/TODO.md) that tries to reflect what
is not working yet and what is being implemented in the future.


## Examples

There's the [examples](/examples) folder that contains small test projects that you can use
to find out how APIs work in detail. They are similar to unit tests in nature, because `go test`
cannot generate binaries for the `syscall/js` platform.


## Projects

These are the Projects using `gooey` as a library. This list is meant to showcase how to use the
library, how to integrate it into your workflow, and how to integrate it with [webview/webview_go](https://github.com/webview/webview_go).
